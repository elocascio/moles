A code Package that let you do some molecular stuff:

HTMD.py - High Throughput Molecular Dynamics - Builds a protein-ligand in water system starting from the receptor (pdb) and the ligand (mol2, coordinate
must be of the docked conformation). Ligand topology is made with MATCH.pl Runs minimization, equilibration, Production and 
makes a set of analysis (RMSD and contact analysis via plip_contact.py)

HTMD_pool.py - same of HTMD, but multiprocessing... can spam a lot of process. Careful with that GPU, Eugene!

make_mdp.py - it writes mdp files for gromacs.

make_ndx.py - it writes gromacs index file using MDAnalysis CHARMM-like selection

native.py - Native Contact Analysis using MDAnalysis. it will give you matrix of contacts per residues over time. Those matrixes can be
subtracted or divided if a reference matrix is given.

plip_contact.py - makes contacts analysis for protein-ligand interaction using plip and MDAnalysis library. It can detect Hydrophobic,
T and P pi-stacking, pi-cation, H-bond, Salt bridge, water bridge interactions.

protein_contacts.py - makes contact analysis for protein-protein interaction using MDAnalysis. it can detect Hydrophobic, H-bond, Salt bridge and polar
interaction. pi-stacking and pi-cation will come.

protein.py - builds a simple protein in water system running minimization, equilibration and profuction. Multiple site mutations can be done.

rms.py - calculate RMSD (using PLUMED [it rebuilds better the system broken by PBC... sometimes]) and cluster via gromacs.

utils.py - a bunch of functions
